📘 Project Name: Portfolio Website Server with Multiple Pages

🔗 Local Preview: http://localhost:3000

🔗 Hosted Project: https://reaport.netlify.app/

🎯 Objective:
Build a simple yet structured multi-page personal portfolio site using React and React Router, and serve the production build using a Node.js + Express server. This project reinforces the concept of serving static files and mirrors real-world deployment practices.

🧠 Concepts Covered (Unit 2):
▫ Serving Static Files with Express
▫ React Production Build using Vite
▫ Routing with React Router
▫ Wildcard Routing for SPA support
▫ Folder Structuring for Fullstack Projects
▫ Fallback Route for 404 Pages

🛠️ Features to Implement:
▫ Home, About, and Projects pages
▫ A shared navigation bar across all pages
▫ Clean React component structure with React Router
▫ Static build served via Express
▫ 404 Page for unmatched routes

📦 Concepts Breakdown:
🔹 React Router – Used for multi-page navigation in the SPA
🔹 Express Static – Makes the `dist/` folder accessible to the browser
🔹 Wildcard Route – Handles deep linking by redirecting all routes to `index.html`
🔹 Separation of Concerns – Clear separation of frontend components and server logic
