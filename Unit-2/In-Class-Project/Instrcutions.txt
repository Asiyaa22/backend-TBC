📘 Project Name: React Static App with Express Server

🔗 Local Preview: http://localhost:3000

🔗 Hosted Project: https://staticserver11.netlify.app/

🎯 Objective:
Demonstrate how to serve a React application built using Vite through a Node.js + Express backend. This project aligns with Unit 2's goal: serving static files using a custom server.

🧠 Concepts Covered (Unit 2):
▫ Serving static files with Express
▫ React build process using Vite
▫ Folder structuring for frontend-backend separation
▫ Using Express middleware (`express.static`)
▫ Handling wildcard routes to support client-side routing

🛠️ Features Implemented:
▫ A basic React UI created with Vite
▫ Production-ready React build using `npm run build`
▫ Express server (`server.js`) to serve the `dist/` folder
▫ Wildcard route handling to support SPA routing
▫ Clean file structure separating server logic from frontend code

📦 Concepts Breakdown:
🔹 Vite – Modern build tool used to scaffold and bundle the React project
🔹 Express – Lightweight Node.js framework to serve the built static files
🔹 `express.static` – Middleware that makes the `dist/` directory publicly accessible
🔹 Wildcard `app.get('*')` – Ensures all routes point to `index.html` for SPA compatibility
