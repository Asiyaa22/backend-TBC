📘 Project Name: Task Manager with Priority & Status

🔗 Local Preview: http://localhost:5173

🔗 Hosted Project: https://taskmana11.netlify.app/

🎯 Objective:
Build a task manager application that allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and filter tasks. This project emphasizes implementing full CRUD functionality using React state without connecting to any backend or database.

🧠 Concepts Covered (Unit 3):
▫ useState for managing task list state
▫ Controlled Components for forms
▫ Conditional Rendering
▫ List Rendering using map()
▫ CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
▫ Filter Functionality
▫ Component-based Architecture

🛠️ Features Implemented:
▫ Add new tasks with title, status, and priority
▫ Edit existing tasks
▫ Delete individual tasks
▫ View a list of all tasks
▫ Filter tasks by priority and status (Pending/Completed)
▫ Basic responsive layout with separation of components

📂 Component Structure:
src/
│
├── App.jsx                         # Root component managing state and layout
├── index.jsx                       # Entry point of the application
└── components/
    ├── TaskForm.jsx                # Form to create or update a task
    ├── TaskList.jsx                # List rendering all tasks
    ├── TaskItem.jsx                # A single task block with edit/delete
    └── FilterBar.jsx               # Filtering UI for priority/status

📦 Concepts Breakdown:
🔹 useState – Core hook for task data and form state
🔹 Controlled Components – Managing form inputs (title, status, priority)
🔹 Component Communication – Prop-based data and function flow
🔹 Filtering – Controlled select elements to change visible task list
🔹 Conditional Rendering – “No tasks” message when list is empty
